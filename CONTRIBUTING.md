# Contributing to Angular MDC

We would love for you to contribute to Angular MDC and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#coc)
 - [Found a Bug?](#found-bug)
 - [Submit an Issue](#submit-issue)
 - [Submit an Pull Request](#pull-req)
 - [Development Process](#dev)

## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct
Help us keep Angular MDC open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/trimox/angular-mdc-web/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## <a name="found-bug"></a> Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue). Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](#pull-req) with a fix.

## <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submit an Issue
Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using https://codepen.io. Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:

- version of Angular used
- version of Material Design Components used
- 3rd-party libraries and their versions
- and most importantly - a use-case that fails

You can file new issues by filling out our [new issue form](https://github.com/trimox/angular-mdc-web/issues/new).

## <a name="pull-req"></a> Submit a Pull Request
When submitting PRs, make sure you're following our commit message conventions; our commit-msg hook should automatically enforce this. We also use [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen), which you can use to auto-format commit messages for you.

Commit message type must be one of the following:
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

When submitting PRs for large changes, be sure to include an adequate background in the description so that reviewers of the PR know what the changes entail at a high-level, the motivations for making these changes, and what they affect.

## <a name="dev"></a> Development Process
Check out our [Developer guide](https://github.com/trimox/angular-mdc-web/blob/master/docs/developer.md).
